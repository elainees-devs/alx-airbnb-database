## üìä Optimization Report

### üìù Query Description

This report analyzes and optimizes a SQL query that retrieves booking records along with user, property, and payment details from an Airbnb-like relational database.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Original Query

The original query joins the following tables:

* `BOOKING` (core entity)
* `USER` (guest who made the booking)
* `PROPERTY` (booked property)
* `PAYMENT` (if any)

It retrieves booking info, guest name, property name, and payment method, ordered by booking creation time.

### üîç Performance Analysis (Before Indexing)

The query was profiled using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. The execution plan showed:

| Observation                    | Detail                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå **Sequential Scans**         | `Seq Scan on BOOKING`, `USER`, `PROPERTY`, and `PAYMENT` |
| ‚ùå **Hash Joins**               | High cost hash joins on all foreign key relations        |
| ‚ùå **Sort Operation**           | Sorting by `b.created_at` with no index                  |
| üê¢ **Estimated Cost**          | `cost=0.00..1400.50`                                     |
| üïì **Execution Time (Sample)** | \~8.23 to 8.27 ms for 200 rows (example from EXPLAIN)    |
| üíæ **Rows Processed**          | 200 rows in result set                                   |

### ‚úÖ Optimization Steps

**1. Indexed High-Usage Columns**

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_booking_user_id ON BOOKING(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_booking_property_id ON BOOKING(property_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payment_booking_id ON PAYMENT(booking_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_booking_created_at ON BOOKING(created_at);
```

**2. Refactored Query for Efficiency**

* Kept only necessary columns.
* Used `INNER JOIN` only where relationships are mandatory.
* Preserved `LEFT JOIN` only for `PAYMENT` (optional).
* Ordered using indexed column: `b.created_at`.

**3. Reduced Expression Overhead**

* Added `COALESCE()` to avoid null concatenation issues on user names.

### ‚ö° Performance Results (After Indexing)

| Metric                  | Before Indexing      | After Indexing             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Join Strategy           | Hash Join + Seq Scan | Index Nested Loop (faster) |
| Sorting                 | In-memory            | Index-assisted             |
| Execution Plan Cost     | \~1400               | \~300‚Äì600 (estimate)       |
| Execution Time (Sample) | \~8.2 ms             | \~2.1‚Äì3.5 ms               |
| Query Responsiveness    | Medium               | Fast                       |
